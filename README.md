# Analysis

Charter schools dominate the top 5 highest-performing institutions, while district schools constitute the bottom 5. Interestingly, higher per-student budgets don't correlate with better performance, as the lowest-performing schools actually receive substantial per capita funding. Both math and reading scores remain consistent across grade levels within each high school. The data reveals that larger schools and district schools generally have lower passing percentages than their counterparts. Charter schools demonstrate superior success rates overall, potentially attributable to socioeconomic factors. For instance, charter schools' typically smaller size may enable them to attract and retain higher-quality teaching staff.
